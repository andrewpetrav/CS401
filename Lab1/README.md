This program asks the user to enter in a radius for the first circle. The program will loop until the user enters in a valid input (a positive double). The program 
then does the same thing but for the second circle. The program then compares the two circles' radii to see if they are equal. If they are, the program
prints that the circles are even. If they're not, the program prints that they're not. The program that allows the user to enter in two new circles and 
repeats the process over again and again.
