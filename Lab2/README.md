This program allows the user to enter in a name and ID of a student. It then asks for the name and ID of another student. Student s1 and Student s2 are then created 
with their variables being set to the user-given values. The two students' names are then compared if they are not the same, the program tells the user the
students are not the same. If the names are the same, then the two students' ids are compared. If they are the same, the programs tells the user that the
students are the same. If the ids are not the same, the program tells the user that the students are not the same.
